STOCKIT - SALON STOCK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
DEPLOYMENT GUIDE FOR RENDER
=====================================

OVERVIEW
--------
Stockit is a full-stack TypeScript application built with React (frontend) and Express.js (backend).
It uses PostgreSQL for data storage and includes user authentication via Replit OAuth.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
------------------
- Node.js 18+ 
- PostgreSQL database
- Environment variables for authentication and database

PROJECT STRUCTURE
-----------------
/client/          - React frontend (Vite build)
/server/          - Express.js backend
/shared/          - Shared TypeScript types and schemas
package.json      - Root package.json with build scripts
drizzle.config.ts - Database configuration
vite.config.ts    - Frontend build configuration

KEY FILES FOR DEPLOYMENT
------------------------
1. package.json - Contains all dependencies and build scripts
2. server/index.ts - Main server entry point
3. client/src/ - Frontend React application
4. shared/schema.ts - Database schema definitions
5. drizzle.config.ts - Database migrations configuration

BUILD PROCESS
-------------
The application uses a two-stage build process:

1. Frontend Build (Vite):
   - Builds React app to /dist/client
   - Optimizes assets and creates production bundle
   
2. Backend Build (ESBuild):
   - Compiles TypeScript server to /dist/server.js
   - Creates single executable file

BUILD COMMANDS
--------------
npm install              # Install all dependencies
npm run build           # Build both frontend and backend
npm run start           # Start production server
npm run dev             # Development mode (not for production)
npm run db:push         # Push database schema (Drizzle)

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REQUIRED
------------------------------
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@host:port/database
PGHOST=your-postgres-host
PGPORT=5432
PGUSER=your-postgres-user
PGPASSWORD=your-postgres-password
PGDATABASE=your-database-name
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-key
REPL_ID=your-replit-app-id (for OAuth)
ISSUER_URL=https://replit.com/oidc
REPLIT_DOMAINS=your-domain.render.com

PORT=5000 (or PORT provided by Render)

DEPLOYMENT STEPS FOR RENDER
---------------------------

1. CREATE NEW WEB SERVICE
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Choose "Node.js" as runtime
   - Set build command: npm run build
   - Set start command: npm run start
   - Set environment: Node.js 18

2. CONFIGURE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
   - Add all required environment variables listed above
   - DATABASE_URL should point to your PostgreSQL instance
   - REPLIT_DOMAINS should be your Render domain

3. DATABASE SETUP
   - Create PostgreSQL database (Render PostgreSQL or external)
   - Run database migrations: npm run db:push
   - Database tables will be created automatically

4. DOMAIN CONFIGURATION
   - Update REPLIT_DOMAINS with your final Render domain
   - Configure OAuth redirect URLs if needed

5. DEPLOY
   - Render will automatically build and deploy
   - Application will be available on your assigned domain

RENDER CONFIGURATION
-------------------
Build Command: npm run build
Start Command: npm run start
Environment: Node.js 18
Auto-Deploy: Yes (recommended)

HEALTH CHECK
-----------
The application serves on port 5000 by default.
Health check endpoint: / (returns the React app)
API endpoints start with /api/

DATABASE NOTES
--------------
- Uses Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Schema is defined in shared/schema.ts
- Migrations are handled by npm run db:push
- Supports PostgreSQL with connection pooling

AUTHENTICATION
--------------
- Uses Replit OAuth for user authentication
- Requires REPL_ID and proper domain configuration
- Sessions stored in PostgreSQL with express-session
- Users are automatically created on first login

FEATURES INCLUDED
----------------
- Profit Calculator with VAT calculations
- Retail Budget Manager with supplier allocations
- Professional Stock Budget tracking
- Multi-currency support (GBP, USD, EUR)
- Mobile-responsive design
- Interactive onboarding tutorial
- Excel export functionality
- Undo/redo functionality
- User authentication and data persistence

STATIC FILES
-----------
Frontend assets are served from /dist/client
All routes are handled by React Router (client-side routing)
API routes are prefixed with /api/

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------
1. Build fails: Check Node.js version (requires 18+)
2. Database connection: Verify DATABASE_URL format
3. OAuth issues: Confirm REPL_ID and REPLIT_DOMAINS
4. Missing dependencies: Run npm install
5. TypeScript errors: Check shared types in /shared/

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
----------------------
- All API routes require authentication except login
- Session cookies are secure and HTTP-only
- Database queries use parameterized statements
- Environment variables store sensitive data
- CORS configured for your domain only

MONITORING
----------
- Application logs are available in Render dashboard
- Database connection status logged on startup
- Error handling includes user-friendly messages
- Unauthorized access redirects to login

BACKUP & MAINTENANCE
-------------------
- Database backups handled by your PostgreSQL provider
- Application state is stored in database only
- No local file storage used
- Updates can be deployed via Git push

PERFORMANCE NOTES
----------------
- Frontend assets are optimized and compressed
- Database uses connection pooling
- Static files served with proper caching headers
- Mobile-optimized responsive design
